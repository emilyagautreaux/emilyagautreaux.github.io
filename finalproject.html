    <h1> CSC106 Final Project</h1>
    
    <p> My partner, Kaleigh Archambault and I developed an educational app for children to practice drawing the upper and lower case letters of the alphabet. The 
      user interface was designed to be simplistic and easy to follow and understand. It includes features such as a score tracker which increases as the user practices drawing more letters
      and allows the user to change the color of the tracing tool. These features function to enhace the app by promoting creativity and making learning fun and engaging for children. 
      <br>
      <br>
      To begin, click the start button. There the program will take you to a screen with all of the letters of the alphabet. This is where you can practice drawing any letter you wish. Any letter you click on will bring you 
      to a screen to practice tracing. You have the option to choose the color of your tracing tool. The goal is to remain within the lines. After completing a tracing, you will score one point. Try to 
      earn as many points as possible!
